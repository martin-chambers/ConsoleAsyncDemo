# ConsoleAsyncDemo
------------------

I wanted to check 2 things:

1. Can I pass a reference to the same HttpClient object into multiple parallel async operations and expect it to work?
2. Is it really faster to make multiple http requests asynchronously?

The answer suggested to both questions by this console app is 'yes'.
